# Hello!
This is a neat little thing where I can post updates for the game on Github and it gets pulled into the game.
This will probably be deprecated in favour of a Discord Server eventually, but for now, here this is.

You might notice the game kinda sucks right now. Well, thats because it isn't done.\
**Have fun playing Antivirus!**
